### Technical Documentation

  The following are a non-exhaustive sampling of technical documents that I have worked on during my time at CISA and BAIST:
  
   [BAIS 4991 - IT Trends and Medical Imaging](/assets/PDF/BAIS4991%20-%20Research%20Project-%20gk.pdf) 

   > Research Report done in conjunction with Intership 1 for BAIST program. This report briefly discussed trends in the medical industry, special considerations, and a comparison of SaaS for Imaging solutions and their IaaS/PaaS partners primarily in the United States of America. Areas of focus include shifting to cloud-based vendor-neutral archives for storage, web-based/API workflows, and Artificial Intelligence.  Special considerations include the legal/security needs of private health data primarily.
   
   [BAIS 4992 - Evaluation of Wireguard as an VPN alternative to OpenVPN and IPSec](/assets/PDF/BAIS4992%20-%20Research%20Paper-gabrielk.pdf)

   > Research Report done in conjunction with Intership 2 for BAIST program. Research was done into Wireguard as an alternative VPN technology to established technologies such as OpenVPN and IPsec. Found that that while Wiregurad is very performant, lacks tooling to make it truly as scalable from an administrative perspective when compared to OpenVPN or Wireguard.

   [BAIS 3995 - Network Management Capstone Documentation](/assets/PDF/Team3%20-%20Technical%20Documentation.pdf)

   > The project was an RFP for a fictitious medical scanning company operating out of Alberta and Nunavut. The document mostly covers what the team had planned or intended to implement before the COVID-19 shut down at NAIT. This included the L2 and L3 Network topologies and IP addressing schemes, Active Directory Topologies, GPO designs, and more.

   [BAIS 3340 - Enterprise Multi-Layer Switching Lab 2](/assets/PDF/BAIS3430%20-%20LAB2.pdf)

   > Co-Authored technical document submitted for our Enterprise Multi-Layer Switching class. I was responsible Section 3: GLBP Analysis in which I demonstrated through Wireshark how Cisco's proprietary Gateway Load Balancing Protocol works as well as how it is configured.  
  
   [CISA - Base Skype For Business Deployment](/assets/PDF/ResearchLab.pdf)

   > Part of the Unified Communications course at CISA where students had to deploy and document a base install of Skype for Business 2015.

   [CISA - Skype For Business Edge Deployment](/assets/PDF/Lab9-EdgeDcoumentation-Gabrielk.pdf)
