   - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
   -  A remotely accessible WAN controller for Ubiquity Unifi Products

   - A simple mail server with Cal-Dav sync for contacts and calendar
   - Can also host websites like this one (<https://www.gabrielk.ca>)
4. Pi-Hole (Not available on internet)
   - a DNS filtering/blocker that is user configurable to block malicious websites akin to using OpenDNS
